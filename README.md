# Duval's Algorithm for Binary de Bruijn Sequences

This program implements Duval's algorithm to generate binary de Bruijn sequences. The algorithm always returns the lexicographically smallest (first in the alphabet) sequence of a given order. We print the result to `stdout` in human-readable form, using one byte per digit.

A major advantage of Duval's algorithm is that it runs in amortized `O(1)` time per bit and requires only `O(n)` memory. For almost all use cases, `n` will be less than 40, so the memory usage is negligible. This implementation also runs about 20-40% faster than my [prefer-one implementation](https://github.com/man4/prefer-one) for medium-sized inputs (`20 <= n <= 24`).

## Compiling

To compile, just run `make`. To clean up the directory, use `make clean`.

## Usage

To generate the order-`n` sequence, run `./duval n` (Linux) or `duval.exe n` (Windows). The value of `n` can be any positive `int`.

For example, to generate the order-`8` sequence and pipe the result to `output.txt`, run `./duval 8 > output.txt` (Linux) or `duval.exe 8 > output.txt` (Windows).

## Examples

Shown below are the order-`n` sequences generated by the program, for `n <= 6`:

n=1: `01`

n=2: `0011`

n=3: `00010111`

n=4: `0000100110101111`

n=5: `00000100011001010011101011011111`

n=6: `0000001000011000101000111001001011001101001111010101110110111111`
